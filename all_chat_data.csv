For a marriage biodata, the photo should present you in a clean, professional, and approachable manner. Here are some key tips:  

1. **Attire**:  
   - Wear formal or semi-formal clothing, such as a shirt (light or neutral colors) or a traditional outfit.  
   - Ensure your clothes are clean and well-fitted.  

2. **Pose**:  
   - A simple, upright posture with a pleasant smile works best.  
   - Avoid overly casual or awkward poses.  

3. **Background**:  
   - Use a clean, light-colored, or neutral background (like white, beige, or light blue).  
   - Avoid busy or cluttered backgrounds.  

4. **Framing**:  
   - The photo should focus on your face and upper body (chest up).  
   - Make sure the photo is well-lit and clear.  

5. **Grooming**:  
   - Be well-groomed with neat hair and facial hair (if applicable).  

6. **Expression**:  
   - A warm and confident smile looks best.  

If you'd like, I can guide you further on getting the photo right or creating a professional layout with your biodata!",thik hai

üîç Key Features:

Detailed Breakdown: View scores for individual students, subjects, and terms.
Interactive Visuals: Easily filter data to analyze trends, high achievers, and areas of improvement.
Performance Insights: Gain insights into overall student performance, class averages, and top performers.

üõ†Ô∏è Built with [Power BI], this dashboard makes it simple to identify learning patterns and focus on areas that need attention.

Check out the attached demo file! Let me know your thoughts and suggestions!

üåü Excited to Share My Achievement! üåü  

I am thrilled to have successfully completed the **IBM SkillsBuild Mastering Data with Machine Learning Internship** in collaboration with **CSRBOX**. This internship has been an incredible journey of learning, exploring, and mastering key concepts in data and machine learning.  

From October 22nd to November 5th, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of machine learning techniques, work with real-world data, and hone my analytical skills. This experience has not only enriched my knowledge but also fueled my passion for leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.  

A big thank you to the amazing mentors and the team at **CSRBOX** and **IBM SkillsBuild** for providing this platform and guidance throughout the internship.  

Looking forward to applying these skills in upcoming projects and making a meaningful impact in the world of technology!

Given 2 resources with powers A and B respectively. At each second, you have to select one resourcelout of 2 to run the software. The power of the resource at the time of selection should be greater than 1. Every second, the power of the selected resource gets reduced by 2 and the power of unselected resource gets charged by 1. The software stops when at least one resource has O power.

You are given integers A and B.

Print the maximum number of seconds your software can run if you select the resources optimally

Function description

Complete the function PowerLimit(). This function takes the following 2 parameters and returns the required answer:

‚Ä¢ A: Represents the power of the first resource

B: Represents the power of the second resource

Input format for custom testing

Note: Use this input format if you are testing against custom input or writing code in a language where we don't provide boilerplate.code

‚Ä¢ The first line contains an integer A denoting the power of the first resource.

The second line contains an integer B denoting the power of the second resource

Output format

Print the maximum number of seconds your software can run if you select the resources optimally

Output format

Print the maximum number of seconds your software can run if you select the resources optimally.
